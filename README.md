Introduction

Text classification is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP) that finds
applications across various domains, including sentiment analysis, spam detection, and topic
categorization. In recent years, deep learning has revolutionized the field of NLP, with
techniques like transfer learning offering significant improvements in model performance and
efficiency. The assignment at hand tasks us with selecting a text classification dataset and
applying transfer learning techniques using the AWD_LSTM pre-trained language model in
fastai, following the ULMFiT (Universal Language Model Fine-tuning) methodology.
Additionally, we are required to develop a more traditional NLP model for comparison.

Data Selection and Business Applications

I chose the "Tweet sentiment extraction" dataset sourced from Kaggle for its relevance in
analyzing tweet sentiments, a critical aspect of modern business strategy. This dataset, originally
from Figure Eight's Data for Everyone platform, includes tweets labeled with sentiments
(positive, negative, neutral) and supporting phrases. For example: "My ridiculous dog is
amazing." [sentiment: positive]. [1]
This datasetâ€™s text classification analysis can address several business problems: automating
customer service responses, conducting market research to gauge customer satisfaction,
managing crises by monitoring public reactions, and measuring the effectiveness of advertising
campaigns through sentiment analysis. Using this dataset, businesses can develop models to
analyze and respond to their social media sentiments, enhancing strategic decision-making and
business intelligence.
